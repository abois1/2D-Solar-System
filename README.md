# 2D-Solar-System
This is the 2D Solar System repository. This repo is to keep track of our progress in making a randomly generated 2D Solar System. This project will help us practice our skills in p5.js and our object oriented coding while applying the js skills that we have learned to date. Our code can be found in the link on the right.
